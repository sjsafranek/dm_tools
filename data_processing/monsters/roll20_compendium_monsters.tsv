The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10; 1 hit point; and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed; each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time; and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour; and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual; if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual; they must start over.""}]"
